            You're alone
            You're on your own
            So what? Have you gone blind?
            Have you forgotten what you have and what is yours?
            
            Glass half empty, glass half full
            Well, either way, you won't be going thirsty
            Count your blessings not your flaws
            
            You've got it all
            You lost your mind in the sound
            There's so much more, you can reclaim your crown
            You're in control
            Rid of the monsters inside your head
            Put all your faults to bed
            You can be king again
            
            You don't get what all this is about
            You're too wrapped up in your self-doubt
            You've got that young blood, set it free
            
            You've got it all
            You lost your mind in the sound
            There's so much more, you can reclaim your crown
            You're in control
            Rid of the monsters inside your head
            Put all your faults to bed
            You can be king
            
            There's method in my madness
            There's no logic in your sadness
            You don't gain a single thing from misery
            Take it from me
            
            You've got it all
            You lost your mind in the sound
            There's so much more, you can reclaim your crown
            You're in control
            Rid of the monsters inside your head
            Put all your faults to bed
            You can be king
            
            You've got it all
            You lost your mind in the sound
            There's so much more, you can reclaim your crown
            You're in control
            Rid of the monsters inside your head
            Put all your faults to bed
            You can be king again
